#### Web design research report
  
“It’s up to us - One thing is certain. The Web will have a profound effect on the markets and the cultures around the world:
intelligent agents will either stabilise or destabilise markets; the demise of distance will either homogenise or polarise cultures;
the ability to access the Web will be either a great divider or a great equaliser; the path will either lead to jealousy and hatred or peace and understanding.” - Sir Tim Berners-Lee,
Inventor of the World Wide Web and Director of the World-Wide Web Consortium Realising the Full Potential of the Web

In this article, Sir Tim Berners-Lee describes how the Web was designed to be a universal information space. 
The first goal was to improve collaboration using hypertext, and the second was to map all the relationships on the Web using linked data.

Many people today use the Web to communicate, access information, connect, learn, and transform problems into solutions. 
Frustrating or exclusive experiences can now become easy and accessible. However, we should also be careful, as we only really know the impact of our designs once we test them. 
In this project, we will explore the impact of the Internet on individuals and communities while learning and applying web design tools, techniques, and accessibility standards.
